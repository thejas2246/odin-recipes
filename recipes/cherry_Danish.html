    <p>
      This shortcut cherry Danish is simple to make with refrigerated crescent
      dough sheets. Filled with a dollop each of sweetened, whipped cream cheese
      and cherry pie filling, and glazed after baking, they're delicious without
      being time-consuming.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) tube crescent dough sheet</li>
      <li>4 ounces reduced-fat cream cheese</li>
      <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract, divided</li>
      <li>1/2 cup cherry pie filling</li>
      <li>1/2 cup confectioners sugar</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons milk, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet
        with parchment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Without unrolling, slice crescent dough sheet into 10 equal portions.
        Place crescent dough rounds onto the prepared baking sheet. Press the
        back of a tablespoon into the center of each roll to make an
        indentation.
      </li>
      <li>
        For filling, add cream cheese, white sugar, and 1 teaspoon vanilla to a
        bowl, and beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Dollop filling into
        the indentations in the rolls.
      </li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 8 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Remove Danishes from the oven. Add a spoonful of cherry pie filling
        containing 4 or 5 cherries into each Danish.
      </li>
      <li>Return to the oven; bake until golden, about 9 minutes more.</li>
      <li>
        To glaze, whisk confectionerâ€™s sugar, remaining 1/2 teaspoon vanilla,
        and enough milk together to form a pourable glaze; drizzle over
        cherry-topped Danishes while still warm and enjoy.
      </li>
    </ol>
